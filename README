  - SHORT DESCRIPTION (see below for in depth description):
      - This class is the "Main" class of this project. It executes the fundamental methods described in the assignment:
          1. Adding an appointment (to the member variable ArrayList<Appointment> appts)
          2. Listing the appointment(s) (from the member variable ArrayList<Appointment> appts)
          3. Exiting the program
      - Completed by using the Appointment and Time classes.
      - You can only schedule future appointments for the current day.
            - Ex: If it's 3:00PM, you can only schedule appointments until 11:59 PM for the same day.

Appointment.java
  - SHORT DESCRIPTION (see below for in depth description):
      - This class has two member variables, a Time object and an ApptType (enum).
          - These member variables characterize appointments by their starting time and appointment type.

Time.java
  - SHORT DESCRIPTION (see below for in depth description):
      - This class has 3 member variables: int hour, int minute, and String AMPM.
      - Represents the Western style of displaying time (HH:mm a) where HH is from 1~12, mm is 0~59 and a is AM or PM.

HOW TO RUN:
  1. This project runs from the command line. I used the MAC OSX terminal to develop this project.
  2. Compile the .java files using command: javac Scheduler.java
      - This will result in Scheduler.class, Appointment.class, Appointment$ApptType.class, and Time.class files.
  3. Run the program with this command: java Scheduler
  4. Follow the instructions that are printed from the program.
